00:00:06,443 --> 00:00:09,996
- Hi and welcome to Ultimate
Go Programming LiveLessons.

2
00:00:09,996 --> 00:00:13,406
My name is William Kennedy
and I am the author

3
00:00:13,406 --> 00:00:17,379
of the, Go in Action, book
and the blog goinggo.net.

4
00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:21,048
I also am the managing
partner of Ardan Labs

5
00:00:21,048 --> 00:00:25,215
and Ardan Studios where we work
on Go projects all the time.

6
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:30,962
This video class is based
on the physical classes

7
00:00:30,962 --> 00:00:34,659
that I teach week in and week
out throughout the world.

8
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:37,377
I do a lot of free classes on weekends

9
00:00:37,377 --> 00:00:40,401
but we do a lot of corporate
three and four day classes,

10
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:42,911
and I finally felt now is the time that

11
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:45,177
this material was in a particular place

12
00:00:45,177 --> 00:00:47,988
where I could deliver to you over video,

13
00:00:47,988 --> 00:00:49,783
and this is where we're at now.

14
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:52,091
And I really hope you enjoy this course.

15
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:55,746
And really, at the end what
I want is that you can love

16
00:00:55,746 --> 00:00:58,736
and appreciate Go as much as I do.

17
00:00:58,736 --> 00:01:03,133
I have taken four years of
writing and thinking about Go

18
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:06,036
and been able to put it
together in this class.

19
00:01:06,036 --> 00:01:06,962
So in this class,

20
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:08,747
what we're gonna be
covering is three things.

21
00:01:08,747 --> 00:01:11,618
It's three things that I
think are incredibly important

22
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:12,832
to learning anything.

23
00:01:12,832 --> 00:01:16,352
History, mechanics and then design.

24
00:01:16,352 --> 00:01:17,841
So I'm gonna give you
a little bit of history

25
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:21,353
throughout this course
about where these idioms,

26
00:01:21,353 --> 00:01:22,976
where these things are coming from.

27
00:01:22,976 --> 00:01:25,593
Then I'm gonna be
sharing you the mechanics

28
00:01:25,593 --> 00:01:27,781
of how things work inside and out,

29
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:30,520
and finally we get to talk about design,

30
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,662
and how to leverage
all of this information

31
00:01:33,662 --> 00:01:37,412
to do things in a
productive and correct way.

32
00:01:38,256 --> 00:01:39,544
So, from the language mechanics

33
00:01:39,544 --> 00:01:42,456
we'll get into type and data structures.

34
00:01:42,456 --> 00:01:44,588
We're gonna learn how this language works.

35
00:01:44,588 --> 00:01:47,823
Then from a software design
we're gonna focus on decoupling

36
00:01:47,823 --> 00:01:51,144
and composition and error
handling and packaging

37
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,354
and how we can think about architecturing

38
00:01:53,354 --> 00:01:55,166
and designing software.

39
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,514
And finally of course you're gonna

40
00:01:56,514 --> 00:01:57,964
want that concurrency stuff,

41
00:01:57,964 --> 00:02:00,637
Goroutines, data races,
channels, patterns,

42
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:04,627
ways to think about writing
multithreaded software in Go,

43
00:02:04,627 --> 00:02:06,099
and once all that's done

44
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:08,583
and you have that strong foundation,

45
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,954
we'll talk about testing
and really cool things

46
00:02:10,954 --> 00:02:13,132
around how you can profile that code,

47
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:15,843
but I always want us to be focusing on

48
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:18,013
optimizing for correctness first.

49
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:22,134
This is gonna be a very big
theme throughout this class.

50
00:02:22,134 --> 00:02:26,899
So I am so excited that I
finally get to share this class

51
00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:30,174
almost in its entirety with you,

52
00:02:30,174 --> 00:02:32,726
and you don't have to
worry about not being able

53
00:02:32,726 --> 00:02:34,866
to have that corporate
classroom environment.

54
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:36,271
I've tried to deliver

55
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:39,447
that corporate classroom
environment to you.

56
00:02:39,447 --> 00:02:42,542
So, hopefully now you're ready to go.

57
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:44,667
Sit down, get that drink,

58
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:48,188
get as excited as I am about this class,

59
00:02:48,188 --> 00:02:52,432
and hopefully at the end of
the day you see the beauty

60
00:02:52,432 --> 00:02:56,349
that this programming
language, Go, really has.
